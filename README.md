# Audio Event Detection
It is an audio classification problem, technically known as "Audio Event Detection". 
Each audio file corresponds to an event class, e.g., children-playing, dog-barking, drilling, etc. The folder "audio_train_1ch/" contains the mono audio files (1761 wav files) and the file "labels_train.csv" contains the class labels.
