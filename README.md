# Audio Event Detection
It is an audio classification problem, technically known as "Audio Event Detection".\
Each audio file corresponds to an event class, e.g., children-playing, dog-barking, drilling, etc. The folder [audio_train_1ch](https://github.com/shiv-goel/Audio-Event-Detection/tree/master/Training%20Data/audio_train_1ch) in [Training Data](https://github.com/shiv-goel/Audio-Event-Detection/tree/master/Training%20Data) contains the mono audio files (1761 wav files) and the file [labels_train](https://github.com/shiv-goel/Audio-Event-Detection/blob/master/Training%20Data/labels_train.csv) contains the class labels.\
There are 2 tasks to be performed:\
\
TASK 1: Given an audio file corresponds to a single event, find out that event.\
Evaluation: Accuracy\
\
TASK 2: Given an audio file contains a sequence of events occurring one after the other, find out that sequence of events. A sequence can contain at least 1 and at most 5 events.\
Evaluation: Edit distance\
    • Return sequence of classes separated by hyphen "-". 
        e.g. street_music-dog_bark-engine_idling \
    • Labels would not repeat consecutively, e.g., street_music-dog_bark-dog_bark will be labeled as street_music-dog_bark

Python notebook corresponding to Task 1 is [Task 1](https://github.com/shiv-goel/Audio-Event-Detection/blob/master/MLSP_Project_Final.ipynb) and the one corresponding to Task 2 is [Task 2](https://github.com/shiv-goel/Audio-Event-Detection/blob/master/MLSP_Project_Final(2).ipynb).
